The Woo and Lam Pi f protocol is a variant of the original Woo and Lam Pi protocol, 
designed for secure authentication between two principals with the assistance of a trusted third party. 
This version specifically emphasizes the use of shared keys for encryption and authentication. 
Here's a concise description:
1. Alice starts the authentication process by sending her identity (A) to Bob, 
signaling her intention to establish a secure communication.

2. Bob generates a nonce (Nb) and sends it to Alice. 
This nonce acts as a challenge to prove Alice's identity in a secure manner.

3. Alice constructs a message containing her identity (A), Bob's identity (B), 
and the nonce (Nb). She then encrypts this message with the shared key between her and the Server (S), 
Kas, and sends this encrypted message to Bob. This step aims to prove Alice's 
identity to Bob by utilizing the shared secret with the Server.

4. Bob forwards the message received from Alice to the Server for verification. 
He includes the original message from Alice and adds his own identity (B) and the 
nonce (Nb) for context. This entire package is encrypted with the shared key between 
Bob and the Server, Kbs, ensuring that only the Server can decrypt and verify the contents.

5. The Server decrypts Bob's message using Kbs, verifies the authenticity and integrity 
of Alice's message, and then constructs a new message containing Alice's and Bob's 
identities along with the nonce (Nb). This message is encrypted with the shared key 
between Bob and the Server, Kbs, and sent back to Bob.
This confirms to Bob that Alice's identity has been successfully authenticated.
