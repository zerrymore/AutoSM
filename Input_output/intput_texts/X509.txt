The CCITT X.509 version 1 protocol is a security mechanism designed to ensure secure 
communication between two principals, often referred to as Alice (A) and Bob (B), within a network. 
Both Ta, Na, Xa and Ya are fresh nonce. Tha public key of both roles are known publicly.

Alice initiates communication by sending a message to Bob that includes her identity (A), 
a timestamp (Ta) to mark the message's time, a nonce (Na) for ensuring the message's freshness, 
Bob's identity (B), some data (Xa), and user-specific data (Ya) encrypted with Bob's public key (PK(B)) for confidentiality. 

This entire package, except the encrypted part {Ya}PK(B), is then signed with Alice's private key (SK(A)) to ensure authenticity.
The signed part includes a hash of the entire message (including {Ya}PK(B)) to verify the integrity and origin of the message.
For simplification, the message which is sent from A to B is  `<A, Ta, Na, B, Xa, {Ya}PK(B), hash_part, {hash_part}SK(A)>`
where `<...>` operator denotes concatation of string, {}PK denotes asymmetric.
