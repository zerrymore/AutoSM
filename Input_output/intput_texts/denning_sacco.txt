The Denning-Sacco protocol facilitates secure communication by allowing two parties (Alice and Bob) \
to establish a shared session key via a trusted Key Distribution Center (KDC). \
    
Alice initiates the communication by sending a message to the KDC (S), \
requesting a session key to communicate with Bob (B). The message includes the identities of Alice (A) and Bob (B). 
    
The KDC responds to Alice with an encrypted message using Kas. The message includes: \
(1) The identity of Bob (B), indicating the session key is for communication with Bob. \
(2) The session key (Kab) for Alice and Bob to use. \
(3) A timestamp (T) to ensure the message's freshness which is a fresh nonce.
(4) An encrypted part for Bob {Kab, A, T}Kbs, which includes the session key (Kab), the identity of Alice (A),\
and the timestamp (T), all encrypted with Bob's key (Kbs). This ensures that only Bob can decrypt and use this information.

Alice forwards the encrypted part {Kab, A, T}Kbs to Bob. \
This message allows Bob to decrypt it using his key (Kbs) to retrieve the session key (Kab) \
and verify Alice's identity and the message's freshness with the timestamp.
