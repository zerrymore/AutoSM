Alex computes a nonce and sends it to Blake. (A -> B: ANonce)
When Blake receives Alex's nonce, Blake computes their own nonce and sends it to Alex. (B -> A: BNonce)
When Alex receives Blake's nonce, Alex does two things: Alex installs a session key SK, which is derived 
from ANonce and BNonce by applying a key derivation function (i.e., SK = kdf(ANonce, BNonce)).
Once the session key is installed, Alex sends a message with the string "ACK"  to Blake (A -> B: "ACK") 
and switches to a 'DONE' state to indicate that the protocol has been executed successfully on Alex's side.
When Blake receives the "ACK" message, Blake also computes the session key SK = kdf(ANonce, BNonce), 
installs it and switches to a 'DONE' state.
